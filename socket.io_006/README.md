Method of listing rooms.

This has all sorts of problems. There's no error checking to see if the room name is empty - or if the user is already in the room. 

BTW this example also sends the socket id back to the client - which is really, really bad. Really.

Nonetheless, you should be able to see some mechanics working from this train wreck.

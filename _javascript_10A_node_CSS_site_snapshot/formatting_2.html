    <!--MAGENTA DIV-->

    <div style=
        "width: 200px;
        height: 200px;
        background: magenta;
        float: left;">
        
        This div has float to it. Here's the
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/float">reference</a>
        on float. Basically, this div will not reset the new line (it will be placed
        wherever the current next line is) it will be placed according to float, around
        it will still allow other elements to flow around it.

    </div>

    <!--RED DIV-->
    
    <div style=
        "width: 220px;
        height: 120px;
        background: RED;
        float: right;">
        
        The red div has right float - this means that it will show up on the right,
        it will be placed at the current new line, and it will not reset the new line,
        and things will flow around it

    </div>

    <!--WHITE DIV WITH BORDER-->
    
    <div style=
        "width: 215px;
        height: 215px;
        border: 1px solid;
        border-color: rgb(0,0,0);">

        <p>
            Hi! It's me the white div with the border. Since Mr. and Mrs. magenta and red
            up there had float settings, they did not reset the newline and thus here I start
            in the upper left corner. You can see that by the location of my border.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because magenta had float though, I repected her space and didn't start my text
            until she was finished. On the other hand, because I 
            <span style=
                "font-weight: bold">
                do not
            </span>
            have float, any subsequent div will 
            start below me.
        </p>
        <p>
            (see how yellow feels about this in the comments)
        </p>

    <!--YELLOW DIV-->
    
    <div style=
        "width: 120px;
        height: 200px;
        background: rgb(255,255,0);;">
        
        
        <!--Yeah, it's me yellow. Because white with border has a fixed height and no float,-->
        <!--I start on a newline below fixed height. This text is in comments because were -->
        <!--it not, it would totally overwrite the text in white's div.-->

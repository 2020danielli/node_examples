## Node Server that sends a file instead of a string
Installation instructions are as before

### Use the res.sendFile with the full path (which is made easire by using __dirname)

**Note that you can make changes to the html files and see them without needing to restart the server.** _Only server changes to side scripts require a server restart to take effect._

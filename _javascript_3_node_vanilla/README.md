## Super Duper Vanilla Node Server for TJ

### In order to make this work, you NEED to do a couple things:

1) cd into public
2) npm install express
3) create your 'run' script
4) set your run script to be excecutable
5) set the script as your process, and start the server.

### NOTE
**Whenever you make changes to your server side script (javascript or shell) you _must_ restart the server in order for them to take effect.**

## Node Server with console logging
Installation instructions are as before

### The intent of this server is to demonstrate console logging.
1) open a new tab with the console.
2) cd into the directory that contains your log file
3) run the command `tail -f info.log` to see live updates of your log file

**You will see logs appear as your server starts up, and any time a user lands at not_a_search.**
